Socket.io
=========

This is a very basic socket based chat application with socket.io node library

You need to install node js on server before running the application.

Node setup is available on http://nodejs.org/.

After installation go to the root directory (where app.js file is present) and then fire command node app.js to run the application !

Enjoy the chat, cheers !
